// "Spying in" refers to creating a struct that implements a similar named method under the same interface but doesn't perform all the exhaustive functional actions.
// For example, the sleeper interface implements the Sleep() method which can be used by SpyCountdownOperations to count the number of method calls. It doesn't
// "sleep" in the sense that it times the function out.
